## Introduction

The spreadsheet is a widely used tool in the biochemical laboratory, both for 
recording and analyzing experiments. When such experiments become a routine we 
often create spreadsheet templates to save time and to structure our work.

The goal of the excelDataGuide package is to be able to use Excel spreadsheets 
as well as scripts as data analysis tools. Clearly, a scripting language 
has more potential when it comes to analyzing large data sets, consisting of 
multiple notebooks.

Importantly, **the source of all data is the spreadsheet.** This concerns 
metadata, parameters like acceptance criteria, concentrations and measured data.
This *one-source* policy guarantees that calculations in the spreadsheet and in
the scripts are all based on the same underlying data and parameters.

Parameters, like acceptance criteria, are determined in the SOP and fixed
in the spreadsheet template, whereas other data may vary per experiment and is
entered by the user. For example, when a user performs parameter fitting, it may
be useful to compare the fitted parameters to those obtained in another 
programming environment.

Concerning calculated data it may or may not be useful to let the spreadsheet be
the source of such data for the script as well. This may be particularly useful 
when it concerns calculations that are carried out automatically upon entry
of data by the user.

## Structuring a template

To provide a link between the data structures of programming languages and 
those in a spreadsheet we consider the following four types of data structures
in a template:

- **keyvalue**: a key-value pair, where the key is a variable name and the value
  is the value of that variable. The key and value are placed in horizontally 
  adjacent cells (columns). The key, or its translated short name (see below)
  is to be used as the parameter name in the scripts and should conform to 
  variable naming rules for the scripting language used. The key is found in 
  the left-most cell of a cell range. The value can be a single value (one cell) 
  or a vector of values (multiple cells).
- **cells**: occasionally it may be more convenient to read values from single
  cells and provide the keys (names) of the corresponding variables in the data 
  guide. These data will be stored as key-value pairs, but in contrast to the 
  **keyvalue** data type where a variable name is provided in the template
  the data guide must provide a variable name.
- **table**: tabular data where columns represent variables and rows represent
  items in which these variables are assessed. Column names are written in the 
  first row and are used as variable names.
- **platedata**: data are registered in the same row-column format as the
  microplate in which the experiment was performed. The first row contains the 
  variable name in its left-most cell, and is followed by (integer) column names. 
  Every subsequent row contains the row name (in capital letters) followed by the 
  values for each well. Both variable name and data are read by the script. The 
  column and row names are ignored. Therefore, the first row and column in the 
  range could also be empty, except for the variable name. Plate data are stored
  as tables in which, apart from the variables provided in the template two 
  additional columns are added, namely row and column, corresponding to the row
  and column in a microplate.

Below is an example of the front page of a template (of the fitc-t4 TTR assay),
illustrating a number of ideas and concepts that we discuss below.

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="First page of a template"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/template_frontpage.png")
```

### A template has a version number

Unique template version numbers are a way to prevent misunderstandings 
between users and are also needed here to check whether a data guide is 
compatible with the template version. 

**Version numbering rules**. We follow the R-package version rules. A version 
number has the structure <kbd>major.minor</kbd> or <kbd>major.minor.patch</kbd>,
where <kbd>major</kbd>, <kbd>minor</kbd> and <kbd>patch</kbd> are each 
integer values. A version consisting of only a major number is invalid, but 
will be interpreted as having a minor version <kbd>0</kbd>, *i.e.* a version
"<kbd>2</kbd>" will be interpreted as "<kbd>2.0</kbd>".

In practice this means that the format of the cell in which the version number
is recorded should be *text*, and not *general* or *number*

**A template name is optional**. Preferably, a template also has a name. Note 
that the example in the figure above doesn't have a name.

**Checking compatibilty of template versions and a guide version**. We use 
template version numbers to check compatibility with a guide. In principle
the same guide can be used for multiple versions of a template as long as the 
locations and names of variables indexed in the guide did not change. This is the 
case when, for example, only explanatory texts or calculations or data validity
checks have changed in the template. When checking version compatibility we 
assume that a guide is compatible with a consecutive range of template versions
between a minimal and a maximal version number.

### All cells are protected except those for data entry

Data entry cells have a distinct background color, here "marker yellow". All 
other cells have protected status to prevent users from inadvertently changing
them.

### Include comments

Refer to the SOP+ version 

### Built-in data entry checks

The validity of data entered by the users should be checked by validity checks, 
especially when misunderstandings are likely to happen. The validity checking
capability by excel is limited. In cases where the data structure can not be 
properly described by a validity rule we add a comment next to the cell in which
the data is entered.

### A single source of parameters

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="The parameters as key-value pairs"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/parameters.png")
```


Parameters needed for calculations, for example for acceptance criteria of 
measurements are best entered on a separate sheet, and referred to by absolute
references in calculations. In the case of the example we have a separate 
hidden sheet called *_parameters* for this purpose. The information in this 
sheet is indexed in the data guide, and therefore available to R-scripts as 
well.

### Use of hidden worksheets for data transfer


```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="A hidden sheet with links to plate-formatted data"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/data.png")
```


## What else?

The keyvalue format will be mostly used for metadata and parameters. All keyvalue 
will be aggregated in a single named list called "keyvalue".

The platedata format will be used for measured data and data concerning 
concentrations in the plate wells. All ranges will be aggregated in a single 
data frame with reported variables as column names, including the column names 
"row" and "col", corresponding to the row and column names of the plate.

## Constructing a guide

Every spreadsheet template should be accompanied by a data guide, and index 
registering the location of different data structures in the template. This
guide is a yaml file, a human editable and computer readable file format.

Below is an example of the first rows of a data guide:

``` yaml
guide.version: '1.0'
template.name: competition
template.min.version: '9.3'
template.max.version: ~
plate.format: 96
locations:
  - sheet: description
    type: cells
    varname: .template
    translate: false
    variables:
      - name: version
        cell: B2
  - sheet: description
    type: keyvalue
    translate: true
    atomicclass:
      - character
      - character
      - character
      - character
      - character
      - date
      - character
      - numeric
      - character
      - numeric
      - character
      - numeric
      - character
      - character
    varname: metadata
    ranges:
      - A10:B21
      - A24:B25
# remainder not shown
```

A guide must contain the following elements:

### Required elements

-  <kbd>guide.version</kbd>: the version of the guide
-  <kbd>template.name</kbd>: a name for the template
-  <kbd>template.min.version</kbd>: The minimal version of the template for which the guide 
   can be used 
   with the guide
-  <kbd>template.max.version</kbd>: The maximal version of the template for which the guide 
   can be used.
-  <kbd>locations</kbd>: the object containing the data locations
-  <kbd>translations</kbd>: the object containing the translations of variable names. 
   Translations can be used both from extended ('long') format to short format 
   and from short to long format. Two functions are provided by the package to
   perform these translations *vice versa*.

### Conditionally required element:

-  <kbd>plate.format</kbd> the format of the microplates used for the experiments. This 
   must be either of '24', '48', '96', or '384'. This is required when a 
   **platedata** element occurs in the **locations**. This plate format is used
   to check the correctness of dimensions of the ranges of **platedata** 
   elements.

The elements in **locations** indicate where data are to be found, whereas the translation 
part contains translations between long and short names for variables. Short 
names are used as variable names in the scripts, whereas long names may be used 
in the spreadsheet, in particular when these are visible to the user. In that 
case the names should be translated before using them in the script. Reverse 
translations may be used by the script in the output document.

## Locations

### Required elements

- <kbd>sheet</kbd>: the name of the sheet in which the data are to be found.
- <kbd>type</kbd>: the format of the data in the range.
- <kbd>translate</kbd>: (*true*, *false*) whether the variable names should be translated before use in the script.
- <kbd>varname</kbd>: the name of the variable in which the data will be available in the script.
- <kbd>ranges</kbd>: an array of ranges in which the data are to be found.

### Optional element

- <kbd>atomicclass</kbd>: the class of the data in the ranges, Can have values "character", 
  "numeric", "integer", "logical" or "date"., It can.be either a singleton or an array of class of the same 
  length as the number of ranges. If a singleton then by default all values are converted to character. 
  If an atomicclass is given then values are coerced. Coercion is performed by the functions `as.character`, `as.numeric`,
  `as.integer`, `as.logical`, respectively, or in case of a date, by a function that produces a Date object.

### Checking against the excelDataGuide json schema

Correctness of the structure and syntax of a YAML file like a data guide can be 
checked against a JSON schema (See [json-schema-everywhere](https://json-schema-everywhere.github.io/yaml)). 
We provide a JSON schema called <kbd>excelguide_schema.json</kbd> in the folder
<kbd>data-raw</kbd>. We use the [Polyglottal JSON Schema Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pajv) 
to validate guides against this schema.
